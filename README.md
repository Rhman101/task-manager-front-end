## MERN Stack Boilerplate Project using a RESTful API: A Full-Stack Learning Project

As the name on the landing page suggests, this is a leanring project. It is my first project that has both a back-end and a front-end, both of which fully funciton together. As such, I'm sure it's rubbish and I'll make something much better in the future. BUT, you have to earn your right to be awesome at something by doing it poorly at first
