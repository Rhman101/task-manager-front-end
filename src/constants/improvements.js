	"I don't feel comfortable that the user can change his email without confirming the change through the new email. I am sure there is a better way, though I am going to leave this as it is for the sake of progress.",
	"I learned about double hashing and I would like to implement it in a future project. It seems like something one really should do if it's a learning project.",
	"I think there must be a better way for the user to change his password. Currently, the method through the profile is pretty standard, but I don't think the method of a new password being emailed and immediately hashed and added to the database is standard. I'm sure there is a better way to do this. Perhaps there is a library that handles all of this kind of thing, though I'm happy I had the experience of doing this myself. My conclusion regarding the war between using libraries and not doing so is that one should try to do things yourself when learning and one should try to use libraries in real-world projects.",
	"I think I understand the idea behind no-cors now. I just enabled cors when I ran into issues earlier, but it's not enabled by default. So, you can limit your API to your own domain, or a specifically given domain. I have to learn about this and implement it in production. Again, I'm moving on for the sake of progress.",
	"I am not good at the artistic side of front-end and I will never pretend to be. I am, though, capable at editing CSS. In this project, I tried to use react-bootstrap with component-level css. I wouldn't do this in production as react-bootstrap provides one with components that already have css that is difficult to edit. You can pass classNames as props, but only some of the css properties seem to make it to the web page. There must be a better way. I'm moving on since I'd rather write algorithms than edit css and since this is a learning project.",
	"With every learning project I complete, I can look back in horror at the rubbish code that I wrote for the previous one. I hope this one will be no different."
